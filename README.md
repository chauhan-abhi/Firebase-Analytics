# Firebase-Analytics

The app is instrumented using Google Analytics for Firebase and logs insightful analytics events in a sample Android app.
You'll be able to play with the sample app to trigger these events (which ultimately populates your Analytics reports) and you'll validate your instrumentation using debug logs.
